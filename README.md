# Diamond-Price-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project-With-CI-CD-Pipeline
Diamond price prediction using machine learning involves creating a model using Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso that estimates the price of diamonds based on various features. A CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline ensures smooth development, testing, and deployment of the machine learning model
